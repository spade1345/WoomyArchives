                    The most

                <li>Made a minor rework to how bot FoV works:

                        <li>Default bot FoV is slighyly less than a player's default FoV when level 60.</li>
                        <li>ALL AI bots now have the same FoV, which is loosely tied to their tank's FoV.</li>
                        <li><b>NOTE:</b> Even though bot FoV has been reworked in this way, all in-game FoVs are
                            square,

                            rectangular, meaning bot FoV on the vertical axis will likely be superior to that of a

                <li>We've added yet another new game mode: Mothership!</li>
                <li>Here are the basics:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are two teams, so there are two Motherships that spawn in the corners of the map.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each Mothership has a name color which matches their team.</li>
                        <li>Unlike Diep and main Arras Mothership, you can press H to control your team's
                            Mothership.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can choose what build your team's Mothership will use, so choose it wisely.</li>
                        <li>Kill the opposing team's Mothership to win the game.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Shoutout to Oblivion Plain for offering us the game mode's code (originally made by CX).</li>
                <li>Since this is a brand new game mode, bugs aren't outside of the picture. If you find some,
                    report
                    them to us
                    so we may fix them.</li>

                        <li>These Dominators spawn yellow, and will attack any tank. Yellow Dominators are
                            considered
                            "contested".</li>
                        <li>If you kill one, you capture it into your team.</li>
                        <li>If the opposing team kills your Dominator, it becomes "contested" again.</li>
                        <li>Capture 4 Dominators, and you win the game! The arena closes and it all resets.</li>
